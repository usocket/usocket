* Bugfix: [LispWorks] Stop using hcl:add-special-free-action for reclaiming unused UDP socket fds to improve multi-threading stablity (suggested by Camille Troillard).
* Bugfix: [LispWorks] Fixed SOCKET-CONNECT on Windows, now LOCAL-PORT never have *auto-port* (0) as default value.

0.5.4:

* Bugfix: [ECL] Fixed for ECL's MAKE-BUILD by removing some unecessary code (reported by Juan Jose Garcia-Ripoll, the ECL maintainer)
* Bugfix: [ACL] Fixed for Allegro CL modern mode.

* Bugfix: [MCL] Fixed WAIT-FOR-INPUT on passive sockets (stream-server-usocket)
* Bugfix: [LispWorks] Fixed using OPEN-UDP-SOCKET in delivered applications (thanks to Camille Troillard and Martin Simmons, this fix is from LispWorks-UDP project).
* Bugfix: [SBCL] Fixed for "SBCL data flush problem", reported by Robert Brown and confirmed by Nikodemus Siivola.

0.5.2:

* General: [SBCL] SOCKET-CONNECT's TIMEOUT argument was limited on non-Windows platforms.
* Bugfix: [CLISP] WAIT-FOR-INPUT now functions right (with/without READY-ONLY), this made Hunchentoot working on CLISP. (Thanks to Anton Vodonosov <avodonosov@yandex.ru>)
* Bugfix: [ABCL] Fix SOCKET-ACCEPT to follow the documented API so that when called without an :ELEMENT-TYPE argument. (Thanks to Mark Evenson, the ABCL developer)
* Bugfix: [LispWorks] Fixed SOCKET-ACCEPT (Windows only) on WAIT-FOR-INPUTed sockets.
* Bugfix: [SBCL, ECL] Fixed wrongly STATE set/unset for WAIT-FOR-INPUT on Windows (report by Elliott Slaughter)
* Enhancement: Additional NAME keyword argument for SOCKET-SERVER for setting the server thread name.
* Enhancement: [ABCL] GET-ADDRESS now works with underlying IP6 addresses.
* Enhancement: [CLISP] missing GET-LOCAL-* methods for STREAM-SERVER-USOCKET was now added.

0.5.1:

* New feature: [CLISP] UDP (Datagram) support based on FFI (Win/Mac/Linux), no RAWSOCK needed.
* Enhancement: SOCKET-SERVER return a second value (socket) when calling in new-thread mode.
* Enhancement: [CLISP] Full support of DNS helper functions (GET-HOST-BY-NAME, ...) added.
* Enhancement: [CLISP] Better network error type detection based on OS error code.
* Enhancement: [LispWorks] Better network error type detection based on OS error code.
* Bugfix: Fixed wrong macro expansions of {IP|PORT}-{FROM|TO}-OCTET-BUFFER functions (since 0.4.0)
* Bugfix: SOCKET-CONNECT didn't set CONNECTED-P for datagram usockets on most backends.
* Bugfix: [SBCL] Fixes for "SBCL/Win32: finalizer problem, etc", by Anton Kovalenko <anton@sw4me.com>
* Bugfix: [SBCL] Fixed SOCKET-SERVER (UDP) on SBCL due to a issue in SOCKET-CONNECT when HOST is NIL.
* Bugfix: [SBCL] SOCKET-CONNECT's TIMEOUT argument now works as a "connection timeout".
* Bugfix: [CMUCL] Fixed SOCKET-SEND on unconnected usockets under Unicode version of CMUCL.
* Bugfix: [CLISP] Fixed and confirmed UDP (Datagram) support (RAWSOCK version).

0.5.0:

* New supported platform: Macintosh Common Lisp (5.0 and up, plus RMCL)
* Support for UDP (datagram-usocket) was added (for all supported platform except MCL)
* Add WAIT-FOR-INPUT support for SBCL and ECL on win32.
* Simple TCP and UDP server API: SOCKET-SERVER
* Completely rewritten full-feature ABCL backends using latest Java interfaces
* Lots of bug fixed since 0.4.1

[TODO]

* New feature: CLISP support some advanced TCP features which CLISP's SOCKET interface not provide
* New feature: Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL) support Datagram sockets (UDP)
